#  Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) – Transcriptomic Network & Ligand-Receptor Analysis

---

## 🌍 Project Summary

> 🧠 **Goal:** To explore molecular signatures of chronic non-healing wounds by identifying **differentially expressed genes**, **protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks**, and **ligand–receptor signaling pairs** in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) vs. diabetic foot skin (DFS) samples.

This project transforms transcriptomic data from **GEO: GSE134431** into biological networks to discover:
- Key **hub genes** and **modules** enriched in wound-healing pathways.
- Potential **ligand–receptor (LR) interactions** driving impaired healing.
- Pathway-level insights through **Reactome enrichment**.

All analyses are modularized into R scripts and reproducible end-to-end on an HPC system.
